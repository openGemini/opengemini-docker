## Reporting a Vulnerability

OpenGemini takes security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe
you have found a security issue in any of our open source projects, please
responsibly disclose it by contacting `security@opengemini.org`. 

OpenGemini highly values and appreciates the members of the research community who find security vulnerabilities and responsibly disclose these to openGemini so that fixes can be issued to all customers. We have our own roots as an open source software company with the philosophy that open source software should be free to use, integrate and create derivative works from regardless of the use case or the user. We develop our software in the open with the help of a global community of developers and contributors with whom we share a common understanding and trust in the free exchange of knowledge.
